# Basic Network Programming Examples

This repository contains a collection of simple networking examples implemented in Go. These examples demonstrate fundamental concepts of network programming and early internet protocols, showing how basic client-server communication worked before the modern web.

## Structure

The repository is organized into several examples, each in its own directory.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Basic understanding of TCP/IP networking
- A terminal emulator capable of running telnet

## Educational Purpose

This repository is designed to help computer science students understand:
- Basic network programming concepts
- How the internet worked before the modern web
- The evolution from terminal-based to HTTP-based communication
- Fundamental client-server architecture
- Protocol design and implementation
- Socket programming
- Concurrent programming with Go

## Historical Context

Before the World Wide Web, the internet was primarily used through terminal-based protocols like Telnet. These examples show the progression from simple terminal connections to basic HTTP servers, helping students understand how modern web technologies evolved.

The examples deliberately avoid using modern web frameworks or libraries to show how these protocols work at their most basic level. This helps in understanding:
- Raw TCP/IP communication
- Basic protocol design
- How HTTP works under the hood
- Why certain design decisions were made in modern protocols

## Usage Tips

1. Start with the basic telnet example to understand socket programming
2. Progress through the examples in order
3. Experiment with different clients (telnet, curl, web browsers)
4. Read the source code comments for detailed explanations
5. Try modifying the code to add new features
